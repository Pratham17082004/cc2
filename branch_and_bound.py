#Branch and Bound systematically explores all possible solutions in a state space tree, but prunes (cuts off) parts of the search tree that cannot lead to a better solution than what we‚Äôve already found
#It‚Äôs like Backtracking, but smarter‚Äîbecause it uses bounds to skip bad paths early.
#Branch: Divide the problem into subproblems (i.e., "branches" of the search tree).
#Bound:For each node, calculate a bound (i.e., an optimistic estimate of the best solution in that subtree). If this bound is worse than the current best solution, prune that branch.
#Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n!)
#Space Complexity: O(n)
